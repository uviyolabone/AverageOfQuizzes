# AverageOfQuizzes

The AverageOfQuizzes program declares an array that can hold 10 quiz scores. 
The user is prompted for a first quiz score; then, a while loop starts and continues as long as the user does not enter 999
Within the loop, the entered score is placed in the scores array, the score is added to a running total, and the count of scores entered is incremented. 
If the score just entered is the tenth score, the score is forced to 999 and the loop ends; otherwise, the user is prompted for the next score. 
The while loop continuously checks to ensure that the user has not entered 999 to quit. 
When the loop eventually ends, count holds the number of scores entered. 
The variable count then can be used to control the output loop and to calculate the average score.
